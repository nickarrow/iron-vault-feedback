# Feedback Note
## General
1. Creating this Starforged world took a bit of time, but this was actually a good thing. Spending time on Truths, and rolling oracles for the sector, locations, NPCs, etc really helped me become engrossed in this campaign. There's something very special about being able to invoke the oracles/moves in-line while you write. For me, I am usually playing late at night, and I can't really "talk all of my ideas outloud". Being able to write in Obsidian, and then invoke the various oracles in line is actually quite magical.
2. I am playing on an iPad, so my limitations are Obsidian Mobile and screen size. I ended up using the Minimal plugin because that gave me more control over font, sidebar sizes, and whatnot. I found myself often enjoying having open the left sidebar to navigate around notes, and the right sidebar for all the awesome Iron-Vault things.
3. Can't wait to play Session 1 tonight!
4. I am toying with the idea of using the Auto-Note-Mover plugin because I kept having to create notes and then manually move them into folders. I created notes for NPCs, settlements, locations, and then had to move them all around. This might be only a minor bit of tedium during Session 0, but if I keep having to move notes around manually, I might have to figure out how to use the Auto-Note-Mover plugin. 

## Bugs
1. There is a strange zero in my character sheet and I have no idea what it is: <img width="1180" alt="Pasted image 20240608212653" src="https://github.com/nickarrow/iron-vault-feedback/assets/40185621/69802692-2c28-40a7-82d9-4efa98bea195">

2. Strange behavior in the character sheet when I add a tick to the legacy tracks or check-off one of the debilities. It jumps me around the character sheet sidebar screen. ![RPReplay-Final1717904086-optimize](https://github.com/nickarrow/iron-vault-feedback/assets/40185621/c369f968-3b31-4e97-901d-6ff38c50651e)

3. Faction Name Template doesn’t work. Can’t get it to roll. 
4. Embedded `Inline tracks and clocks on creation` is kind of bonkers slow/buggy on iPad (haven’t tried PC). I didn’t think I was able to click the +/- but then many minutes later, 5 ticks appeared. Turned it off for now. Just doing a normal `![[progress file name here]]` seems to work just fine. 
5. For all of the rollers that have the `Create entity file` option, this is a great idea. However, the name of the file created should be the name that gets generated. Otherwise I have to go back and rename the entity files, and then my OCD kicks in and I have to change it in the `mechanic` text as well. I stopped using for now. 
6. Character Oracle output has this strange “undefined thing” <img width="1180" alt="Pasted image 20240608233943" src="https://github.com/nickarrow/iron-vault-feedback/assets/40185621/1feb474f-32bd-4196-8af6-c8b7a4035e38">

## UI Suggestions
1. Pasting in Truths was tedious. It will be much more fun to spin up worlds when this could be automated, rolled, and generated. 
2. Looking for screen real estate when playing on iPad. The character sheet boxes don’t play nice if I decrease font size, so it’s kind of locked at its current size. Would be nice if it could scale smaller to give a more condensed view for playing on a smaller screen. 
3. I really wish the mechanics embeds look as great as the move embeds. Don't get me wrong, they are all amazing. But I really like having the oracle embeds in my journal and in my notes about each entity. If they looked as slick as the move embeds, this would be incredible. ![Pasted image 20240609060546](https://github.com/nickarrow/iron-vault-feedback/assets/40185621/ca4b97c2-e161-4322-80d1-5abfe4c0bec6)
