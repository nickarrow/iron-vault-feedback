# Lacuna Anvil 
Within the expanse is the sector known as Lacuna Anvil. A little explored sector with only 3 charted settlements. The sector trouble is:
```mechanics
oracle name="[Campaign Launch Oracles \/ Sector Trouble](oracle:starforged\/oracles\/campaign_launch\/sector_trouble)" result="Notorious pirate clan preys on starships" roll=43 {
}
```

### Factions
Since there is a pirate clan, there must be a faction. Let’s find out what this faction is called.
```mechanics
oracle name="[Faction Oracles \/ Faction Name \/ Legacy](oracle:starforged\/oracles\/factions\/name\/legacy)" result="Kindred" roll=58

oracle name="[Faction Oracles \/ Faction Name \/ Identity](oracle:starforged\/oracles\/factions\/name\/identity)" result="Jackals" roll=33

```
Thus the pirate [[Faction - Kindred Jackals]] has been identified. We don’t yet know much about them, but I am sure we’ll run into them soon enough. 

### Settlements
Let’s determine the 3 charted settlements.

The first settlement:
```mechanics
oracle name="[Settlement Oracles \/ Settlement Name](oracle:starforged\/oracles\/settlements\/name)" result="Amity" roll=4
```
[[Amity]] now exists. We can now add some details (not to much because we haven’t gone there yet) about this settlement. I’ll do that in the note for the settlement itself. 

The second settlement:
```mechanics
oracle name="[Settlement Oracles \/ Settlement Name](oracle:starforged\/oracles\/settlements\/name)" result="Rockhome" roll=76
```
[[Rockhome]] now exists. We can now add some details (not to much because we haven’t gone there yet) about this settlement. I’ll do that in the note for the settlement itself. 

The third settlement:
```mechanics
oracle name="[Settlement Oracles \/ Settlement Name](oracle:starforged\/oracles\/settlements\/name)" result="Nyx" roll=56
```
[[Nyx]] now exists. Details for it in its note. 

### Planets
Since both Rockhome and Nyx are orbital stations, we generated two planets. Rockhome is in orbit around [[Abis Prime]], and Nyx is in orbit around [[Boreas]].
