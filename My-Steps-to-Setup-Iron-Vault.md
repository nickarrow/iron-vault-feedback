# Setting up Iron-Vault for the first time
This list identifies what I did when setting up a brand new iron vault campaign. 

1. Create a new vault with this in mind:
	1.  One vault = One character = One campaign. We’re going to be working on enabling multi-character and multi-campaign stuff soon enough. Eventually the Truths stuff will be pretty independent so you can have as many worlds as you want and organize them however you want.
	2. If you do one vault per character/campaign, you’ll be able to eventually just merge all your vaults together when support is added for that.
2. Enable community plugins 
3. Add the Iron-Vault plugin (via BRAT for now)
4. ~~Turn on `Inline tracks and clock on creation` - this is personal preference, but I really like how it makes the journal look.~~ I actually scrapped this after a few tries because gave me very odd behavior. I think this wil be great in the future.
5. Create the following folders in root of the vault:
	1. Truths
	2. Characters
	3. Progress
	4. Clocks
	5. Journals
	6. Locations
	7. Factions
	8. NPCs
6. Optional - Turn off `Show inline title` in Obsidian settings. I like to use H1 at the top of my docs. Personal preference thing. 
7. Optional - Set `Properties in documents` to `hidden`. This will make things like the character sheet much easier to read since the YAML properties are how hidden.
8. Optional - add a theme. Minimal is nice for many reasons. For me, playing on an iPad, I need screen real estate. So, being able to use Minimal and Style Settings plugin to change the sidebar sizes so that everything “fits on the screen” is super important. 
9. Optional - Set attachments to `In subfolder under current folder`. I expect to be adding images in my journal and other sections (maybe), so I wanted the attachments (probably, mostly, images) to be organized within the vault. 
10. Create a file for Truths. This should be a single file that uses headers for each truth. See [[Truths]].
	1. Right now, you have to copy/paste or write in truths for your setting. I think this will be automated in the future, but for now, copy/paste is your friend. 
11. Spin up a character using the `Create a character` command. 
	1. This will prompt you for a character name, create the file with everything you need, and then put that file in the `Characters` folder. Super slick!
	2. Add Assets by clicking on  “add asset” on the bottom of the character sheet.
12. With truths and your character created, now it’s time to spin up the starting sector and locations. You could do this before creating a character if you wanted.
13. To get things rolling, I started a [[Session 0]] journal where I wrote up some background for my character, a description, and where I created background vow using the `Create a progress track` command.  
14. I also used the Session 0 journal to generate a name for my starting sector. I used the right sidebar to generate a sector name, and then created the note [[Lacuna Anvil]]. 
15. With the sector note created, now I needed to populate it with locations. This sector is in the expanse, so only 3 sectors is needed. 
16. I used the right sidebar to generate sector names, and then created corresponding notes based on those name. Since a few sectors were in orbit, I also used the right sidebar to generate planet names as well. Each location gets its own note, which I’ll be populating with details and/or use the oracle to generate ideas.
17. With 3 settlements created and 2 planets, the last thing I needed to get setup was an NPC. But since I took the Sidekick asset, I actually needed to generate two NPCs. I went back to my [[Session 0]] journal and used the oracle to give me name. Then I created separate notes for the two NPCs.
