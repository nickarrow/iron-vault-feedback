# Iron-Vault-Feedback

This repo is used to house [feedback](Feedback.md) on the incredible [Obsidian Iron-Vault Plugin](https://github.com/cwegrzyn/iron-vault). It also includes:
1. [My Steps to Setup Iron-Vault](My-Steps-to-Setup-Iron-Vault.md)
2. And a full dump of the entire obsidian vault **Iron-Vault-Feedback-Vault**. Feel free to download and load into Obsidian to see how I've been using it.

Hopefully this is helpful to someone.

Cheers
